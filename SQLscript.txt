Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset 
Coursera Worksheet

Hassan Subzwari

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
	i. 	Attribute table = 10000
	ii. 	Business table = 10000
	iii. 	Category table = 10000
	iv. 	Checkin table = 10000
	v. 	elite_years table = 10000
	vi. 	friend table =  10000
	vii. 	hours table =  10000
	viii. 	photo table = 10000
	ix. 	review table = 10000
	x. 	tip table =  10000
	xi. 	user table =  10000
	
Sample code (including NULL values):

select count(*) as totalrecords
from attribute;

+---------------+
| totalrecords |
+---------------+
|         10000 |
+---------------+

2. Find the total number of distinct records for each of the keys listed below:
1.	Business = 10,000
2.	Hours = 1562
3.	Category = 2643
4.	Attribute = 1115
5.	Review = 10,000
6.	Checkin = 493
7.	Photo = 10,000
8.	Tip = 537
9.	User = 10,000
10.	Friend = 11
11.	Elite_years = 2780

	
Sample code:

select count(distinct name)  
+ count(distinct business_id) 
+ count(distinct value)                        
as 
totalrecords
from Hours;

+---------------+
| totalrecords |
+---------------+
|          1562 |
+---------------+

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No.

				or compliment_photos is null

4. Find the minimum, maximum, and average value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:  1 		max:	5	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:  1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995
		

Sample code:

select 
min(stars),
max(stars),
avg(stars)
from review;

              +------------+------------+------------+
              | min(stars) | max(stars) | avg(stars) |

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	No. There is no correlation as we can see from our findings below between Gerald and Herald.

	Answer:There are more reviews with the word "love" as we can see from our table below.
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select
count (*)
from review
where text like '%love%';

+-----------+
| count (*) |
+-----------+
|      1780 |
+-----------+

select
count (*)

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. 	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
	or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to 
	the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
City: Mesa        Category: Food 
	
	i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	Yes.I picked Toronto and Food for this question. The restaurants with only 2.5 stars open from 8:00-22:00 on Saturday. The places with higher rating stars open late on Saturday.
	
	ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
          Yes. The group with 2-3 stars has less review (in this case 10) compared with the group with higher rating stars.

          My query results:

          
	
	iii.	Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Based on the results, we can see that there seems to be a correlation between the location of the business and their rating. The business that are probably located in the same neighbor have close rating. Also they have similar working hours. Moreover, the business that have longer working hours usually have higher rating. 


	SQL code used for analysis:

select
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa' 
 group by business.stars;

		
2.	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What
	differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are
	closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your
	answer.
		
	i. 	Difference 1:
	
The business that are still open have higher rating.
	
	ii.	Difference 2:
	
The business that are still open have more reviews.

	iii.	Difference 3:
The business that are still open have longer working hours.

	SQL code used for analysis:

	select
business.name
, business.is_open
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa' 
 group by business.is_open;

	
3. 	For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you
	want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
	
	Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment 
	analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
	predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a 
	user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel 
	free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide
	answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
	i. 	Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
	Finding correlation between the likes with the given rates and using �like� in the reviews. 
	ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
			
I need two sources of data (tables). First, I join these two tables based on users and business. Then I sort them based on rating to see if there is a correlation between the number of stars and likes. 
The reason I chose this analysis and thus, the data sets is that psychologists have shown that how people think about something can completely change even after a few minutes and they think that how people think just after occurrence of an event is a better representative for the quality of that event compared to what they say after thinking about it. Because tip table is related to the occurrence of the event (shopping) and they write a review after hours or even days, comparing these two tables can help us to explore the validity what psychologists claim. As the result shows there is a slight correlation between the number of likes and stars, but this correlation is not strong. So what psychologists claim seems to be fairly valid.  
		
	iii.	Output of your finished dataset:
	
+-------+-------+
| stars | likes |

|     3 |     2 |
