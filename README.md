# SQL Data Science Project
## This is a Personal Project to showcase my SQL Skills 

I used a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

-You can find my SQL script in this folder

-To better understand it please view the screenshot of the ER diagram I have attached

-I have also attached the entire dataset which you can use in any DBMS to view the database and test my queries against it

Thank You (:
